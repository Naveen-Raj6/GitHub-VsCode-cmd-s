ðŸ”¹ Terminal Command:
rm filename


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The rm (remove) command is used to delete files or directories from the filesystem.
Unlike rmdir, rm can delete both files and folders, but deletion is permanent (doesnâ€™t move to trash/recycle bin).
Use with caution, especially with -r and -f options.


ðŸ”¹ Options:

* filename : Deletes a specific file.
Example: rm data.txt

* file1 file2 : Deletes multiple files at once.
Example: rm a.txt b.txt

* -r or --recursive : Deletes directories and their contents recursively.
Example: rm -r myFolder

* -f or --force : Ignores nonexistent files and doesn't prompt for confirmation.
Example: rm -f temp.txt

* -rf or -r -f : Forcefully delete folders and contents without confirmation.
Example: rm -rf node_modules

* -i : Prompts before every removal.
Example: rm -i file.txt

* -v : Verbose mode â€” shows what is being deleted.
Example: rm -v *.log

rm index.html                  # Delete a file named index.html
