ðŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git push


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The git push command uploads your local repository commits to a remote repository. 
It is used to share changes with other collaborators or to back up your work to a central repository (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

It is essential to push your changes to a remote branch to synchronize your local changes with the remote repository.


ðŸ”¹ Options:
<remote> :-Specifies the remote repository name (e.g., origin).
<branch> :-Specifies the branch to push (e.g., main).
-u or --set-upstream :-Sets the upstream reference, so you can use git push without specifying the remote/branch in the future.
--force or -f :-Forces the push, overwriting the remote branch (use with caution).
--dry-run :-Simulates a push without actually pushing the changes.
--all :-Pushes all branches to the remote repository.
--tags :-Pushes all tags to the remote repository.


ðŸ”¹ Example:
git push origin main
Pushes the local main branch to the origin remote repository.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git push -u origin main
Sets the upstream reference for the main branch on the origin remote so future git push commands can be done without specifying the remote and branch.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git push --force origin main
Forces the push, overwriting the remote main branch (use with caution).

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git push --tags
Pushes all tags to the remote repository.


ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
git push [<remote>] [<branch>] [options]

* remote is usually origin by default.
* branch is the local branch you want to push (like main, develop).
* Common options: -u (sets the upstream), --force (force push), --all (push all branches).
