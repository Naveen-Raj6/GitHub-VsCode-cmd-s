ðŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git reset


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The git reset command resets the current branch's history to a specific state. 
It can modify the staging area and the working directory, depending on the options used. 
It is primarily used to undo changes, remove commits, or move the HEAD pointer to a different commit.

There are three primary modes for git reset:

* Soft Reset: Moves the HEAD pointer but keeps changes staged.
* Mixed Reset (default): Moves the HEAD pointer and resets the staging area, but leaves the working directory unchanged.
* Hard Reset: Moves the HEAD pointer and discards changes in both the staging area and working directory.


ðŸ”¹ Options:
--soft <commit> :-Resets the HEAD pointer to the specified commit, but keeps all changes staged.
--mixed <commit> (default) :-Resets the HEAD pointer to the specified commit and unstages the changes (but keeps them in the working directory).
--hard <commit> :-Resets the HEAD pointer to the specified commit and removes all changes from both the staging area and working directory.
--merge :-Resets the HEAD pointer and adjusts the index, but does not touch the working directory.
--keep :-Resets the HEAD pointer but keeps changes that haven't been modified in the working directory.


ðŸ”¹ Example:
git reset --soft HEAD~1
Resets the HEAD to the previous commit, keeping changes staged for the next commit.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
Resets the HEAD to the previous commit and unstages changes, but keeps them in the working directory.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git reset --hard HEAD~1
Resets the HEAD to the previous commit and discards all changes in the working directory and staging area.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
Resets the HEAD to a specific commit (identified by hash) and discards all changes made after that commit.


ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
git reset [--soft | --mixed | --hard | --merge | --keep] <commit>

* commit can be a commit hash, HEAD~n (n commits ago), or other references like HEAD.
* Common uses include undoing a commit or unstaging changes from the staging area.
