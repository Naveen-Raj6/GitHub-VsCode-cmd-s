ğŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git bisect


ğŸ”¹ Description:
The git bisect command is used to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search. 
This command helps you to quickly identify the problematic commit by testing a range of commits. 
It is especially useful when you need to locate which commit in your repository introduced an issue or bug without manually checking each commit.

The process involves:

* Marking one commit as good (working correctly).
* Marking another commit as bad (where the bug was introduced).
* Git automatically checks out a commit halfway between the two, and you test it to determine if itâ€™s good or bad.
* The process continues until Git pinpoints the exact commit that introduced the problem.


ğŸ”¹ Options:
start <bad> <good> :-Starts the bisect process, where <bad> is the commit where the bug is present and <good> is the commit where the bug is not present.
git bisect good :-Marks the current commit as "good," meaning it does not contain the bug.
git bisect bad :-Marks the current commit as "bad," meaning it contains the bug.
git bisect reset :-Resets the bisect process and returns to the original HEAD.
git bisect skip :-Skips the current commit (useful when you canâ€™t test a commit or itâ€™s not relevant).
--term=<good-term> or --term=<bad-term> :-Customizes the terms used for "good" or "bad" commits.


ğŸ”¹ Example:
git bisect start
git bisect bad <bad-commit-hash>
git bisect good <good-commit-hash>
Starts the bisect process by marking the bad commit (where the bug is present) and the good commit (where the bug is not present).

ğŸ”¹ Example:
git bisect good
Marks the current commit as good, meaning the bug is not present.

ğŸ”¹ Example:
git bisect bad
Marks the current commit as bad, meaning the bug is present.

ğŸ”¹ Example:
git bisect reset
Resets the bisect process and returns to the branch you were working on before.

ğŸ”¹ Example:
git bisect skip
Skips the current commit if it canâ€™t be tested or doesnâ€™t help in identifying the bug.
