ðŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git mv


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The git mv command is used to rename or move files and folders in a Git repository. 
Itâ€™s a shorthand for performing three steps manually:

* mv old-name new-name (move/rename the file in the filesystem),
* git rm old-name (remove the old file from Git),
* git add new-name (add the new file to Git).

Using git mv performs all of these in one command and stages the change for commit.


ðŸ”¹ Options:
-f or --force :-Forces the move even if the target already exists.
-k :-Skips move/rename if the destination file exists.
-n or --dry-run :-Shows what would be done, without actually doing it.
-v or --verbose :-Shows detailed output of the operation.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git mv file.txt docs/file.txt
Moves file.txt to the docs/ folder and stages the move.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git mv old_name.py new_name.py
Renames old_name.py to new_name.py.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git mv -f temp.txt backup.txt
Forces the rename even if backup.txt already exists.

ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
git mv [<options>] <source> <destination>

* source: the file or directory you want to move or rename.
