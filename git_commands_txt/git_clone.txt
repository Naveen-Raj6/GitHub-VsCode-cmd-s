ðŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git clone


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The git clone command is used to create a copy of an existing Git repository. 
It clones the entire repository, including the commit history, branches, and tags. 
Typically, it's used to download a remote repository onto your local machine for the first time, but it can also be used for repositories hosted locally.

By default, git clone creates a copy of the repository in a new directory, but you can specify a directory name if desired.


ðŸ”¹ Options:
<repository> :-The URL of the repository you want to clone (can be an HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, or file path).
<directory> :-The name of the directory to clone the repository into (if not specified, Git will use the repository name).
--depth <depth> :-Creates a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits.
--branch <branch> :-Clones a specific branch of the repository.
--single-branch	:-Clones only the history of the specified branch (useful for large repositories).
--recursive	:-Clones the repository along with any submodules it contains.
--quiet	:-Suppresses output to make the process quieter.


ðŸ”¹ Example:
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
Clones the repository from the specified GitHub URL into a new directory named repository.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repository.git
Creates a shallow clone of the repository, with only the latest commit (a truncated history).

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git clone --branch feature-branch https://github.com/user/repository.git
Clones only the feature-branch from the remote repository.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/user/repository.git
Clones the repository and its submodules (if any) recursively.


ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
git clone [options] <repository> [<directory>]

* repository is the URL or path to the remote repository.
* directory is the optional local directory where you want to store the cloned repository (default is the repository name).
* Options like --depth, --branch, and --recursive customize the cloning behavior.
