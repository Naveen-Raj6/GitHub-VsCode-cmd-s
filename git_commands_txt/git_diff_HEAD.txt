ðŸ”¹ Git Command: 
git diff HEAD


ðŸ”¹ Description:
The git diff HEAD command is used to show the differences between the current working directory (including both staged and unstaged changes) and the last commit (HEAD). 
This allows you to view what changes have been made since the last commit, including both the changes you have staged for commit and the changes that are still unstaged.

If you want to compare the changes in your working directory with the last committed state, this is the command to use.


ðŸ”¹ Options:
git diff HEAD :-Compares the current working directory (including both staged and unstaged changes) with the last commit (HEAD).
git diff HEAD --staged :-Compares only the staged changes (changes that are ready to be committed) with the last commit.
git diff HEAD <file> :-Compares the changes made to a specific file since the last commit.
git diff --name-only HEAD :-Shows only the names of the files that have changed since the last commit.
